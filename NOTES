Following Games had some parsing issues:
1: lack of move information... need to say that piece becomes queen. http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1182320

It is failing on best move... or choose move?
Solution.. set processed of id 1 to 0, then watch verbose.

To do:
Add logging: better verbose specifications.

Eval block in score

Add debug option, exits afer one game, evaluates game in CL arg even if processed.

Add interrupt to parsePGN, so can be stopped safely.

Better specification of data dir
